# Enhanced Coin Flip Game

Welcome to the **Enhanced Coin Flip** project! This Python script simulates the classic "flip a coin" game with added functionality and user engagement. The project is beginner-friendly and showcases Python's randomization capabilities, interactive inputs, and program enhancements for better user experience.

## Features

- Simulates flipping a coin (Head or Tail).
- Provides a detailed log of each flip.
- Allows users to choose the number of flips in a session.
- Tracks and displays flip statistics (e.g., total heads/tails).
- Enhanced interface for better interaction.

## Future Improvements

- **Graphical Interface**: Add a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
- **Data Visualization**: Display results with pie charts or bar graphs using Matplotlib.
- **Database Integration**: Store flip statistics for analysis over time.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple players to take turns flipping coins.
- **Customizable Coins**: Let users design their own coin faces.

## Requirements

To run the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No additional libraries are required (uses only the built-in `random` module).

## How to Use

1. Run the script in your Python environment.
2. Enter the number of coin flips you'd like to simulate.
3. View the results and flip statistics.

### Example Output

```
How many times would you like to flip the coin? 5

Flip 1: Head
Flip 2: Tail
Flip 3: Tail
Flip 4: Head
Flip 5: Head

Summary:
Total Flips: 5
Heads: 3
Tails: 2
```
